FastAPI README
Overview
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

Fast: It is one of the fastest Python frameworks available.
Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn.
Automatic validation: Validate and serialize data with Pydantic.
OpenAPI & Swagger UI: Automatically generate and serve API documentation.
Asynchronous: Supports asynchronous programming and is fully asynchronous.
Features
Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) errors.
Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn.
Automatic OpenAPI documentation: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc.
Type validation: It uses Python type hints for data validation.
Security: It supports security features, such as OAuth2, JWT, HTTPBasic, and more.
Asynchronous programming: Fully supports asynchronous programming (async/await).
Deployable: Easily deploy FastAPI applications on multiple platforms, such as Docker, cloud services, or your own server.
